# Welcome

I am a computer science master’s student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a focus on artificial intelligence.

My research centers around cognitive artificial intelligence and natural language processing, two areas that interest me greatly. 
I also enjoy finding interesting or useful projects to begin working on and develop them until they reach the best iteration they can be.

I have experience in many languages, with JavaScript, Java, and Python being the ones in which my skills are most developed.
I also have experience using the DevOps and Agile methodologies, full-stack development, and 
continuous integration and continuous delivery using AWS Amplify.

More information about my education and specific projects can be found in my [Resumé](https://github.com/matthew-pisano/Resume/blob/master/resume.pdf).

Additionally, my portfolio website can be found at [reactordevelopment.com](https://reactordevelopment.com/).
