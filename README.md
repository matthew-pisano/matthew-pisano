# Welcome

I am a student and researcher working towards a Master’s in Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a focus on artificial intelligence.

My research centers around natural language processing and foundational models, two areas that interest me greatly. 
I also enjoy drawing comparisons between biological and artificial intelligences as inspiration for the work that I do.

I have experience in many languages, with JavaScript, Java, and Python being the ones in which my skills are most developed.
I also have experience in using foundational models, DevOps, full-stack development, and basic cognitive science.

More information about my education and specific projects can be found in my [Resumé](https://github.com/matthew-pisano/Resume/blob/master/resume.pdf).
